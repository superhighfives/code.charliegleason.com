Early 2023 I started working on a project, [Lysterfield Lake](https://lysterfieldlake.com), that took me down a long winding road of generative AI as a tool for creative expression.

I used [Replicate](https://replicate.com) as a jumping off point, exploring models, learning their open-source tool [Cog](https://github.com/replicate/cog), and eventually contructing an offline pipeline to generate the final videos that made up the project.

When I finished it, I sent them a bit of a love letter to say thanks for making cool stuff.

  Hey Replicate,

  I wanted to reach out because I'm a product designer and developer who has been working on a project for the last year or so that was really inspired by (and to be totally honest, only possible because of) your tools. I am such a huge fan of Cog, of your explore page, and of the way you're making generative AI tools accessible and inspiring. I genuinely say Replicate when people ask me if there's a company that I'm excited by or that I'd love to work for (maybe don't mention that last bit to my current employer).

  If you were ever looking for someone to do user research with, or to take a look at beta features, or to just generally talk about your product, I'd be super keen.

  Oh, and the project is here: https://lysterfieldlake.com/

  It's all open source: https://github.com/superhighfives/lysterfield-lake-pipeline

  And I wrote a bit about the process of making it here: https://charliegleason.com/work/lysterfield-lake

  Thanks to the team for making great stuff,<br />
  Charlie.

  Hey Charlie!

  Your generative music video is so cool. Would love to catch up and hear how you made it and how Replicate worked for you. :)

Anyway, in related news, I'm joining Replicate as a staff designer. Happy days. Here's to side projects and love letters.

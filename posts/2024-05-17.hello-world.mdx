Hello world. 👋

I'm a designer and developer who loves the intersection of creativity and code. This site is where I share technical implementations, creative coding experiments, and the occasional tool or resource I've found useful.

You'll find posts about things like [generating OG images with Satori](/satori-vite-remix-cloudflare), [building authentication patterns in Remix](/public-private-remix-routes), and [the value of side projects](/side-projects-and-love-letters). Most posts include working code examples, links to demos, and reflections on what worked (and what didn't).

The site itself is open-source and built with React Router 7, Cloudflare Workers, and a bunch of other bits and pieces. You can find the source code [on GitHub](https://github.com/superhighfives/code.charliegleason.com), and you can subscribe via [RSS](/rss) to get updates when I publish something new.
